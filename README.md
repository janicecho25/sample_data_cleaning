This project contains a sample of data cleaning performed for my Sociology BA thesis.

The data comes from the Korean Longitudinal Study on Aging (KLoSA) [https://survey.keis.or.kr/eng/klosa/databoard/List.jsp]. It is publicly available and de-identified.

Please contact Janice Cho at janicecho@uchicago.edu with any questions.
